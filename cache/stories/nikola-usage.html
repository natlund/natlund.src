<p>Nikola is a static site generator geared towards making blogs.  To make a standard website, a few tweaks are required.</p>
<p>First, note that the front page of a website has the name index.html
It seems that when you point a browser at a folder, if the folder contains a file called <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt>, the browser automatically loads <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt>.</p>
<p>When build is run, Nikola creates an <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> in the root of the output directory.  This <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> is designed to be a generic front page for a blog website.  So it shows the first 500 words from the newest 10 blog posts, or whatever, as well as all the navigation bars, etc.  Nikola actually puts <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> in the root of the output directory, because that is the default location.  We need to change this by uncommenting and altering the INDEX_PATH variable in <tt class="docutils literal">conf.py</tt></p>
<p>Uncomment and change to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
INDEX_PATH = &quot;blog&quot;
</pre>
<p>Now, the Nikola build command creates a blog sub-directory in output, creates the blog-centric <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> file, and dumps it in the <tt class="docutils literal">output/blog</tt> directory.</p>
<p>But we still need an <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> in the root of output to be the front page of our website.  There are various ways to do this, but:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I want the home page .rst file to be easy to find: ideally sitting by itself in a <tt class="docutils literal">/stories/home</tt> directory.</li>
<li>I want to keep the root of output clean.  I don't want <em>all</em> of my web pages there, only the <tt class="docutils literal">index.html</tt> page.  All the rest should be tucked away in <tt class="docutils literal">/output/stories</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that one way to do this is to add a tuple to the <tt class="docutils literal">PAGES</tt> variable in <tt class="docutils literal">conf.py</tt>.  By default, <tt class="docutils literal">PAGES</tt> looks like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
PAGES = (
    (&quot;stories/*.rst&quot;, &quot;stories&quot;, &quot;story.tmpl&quot;),
    (&quot;stories/*.txt&quot;, &quot;stories&quot;, &quot;story.tmpl&quot;),
    (&quot;stories/*.html&quot;, &quot;stories&quot;, &quot;story.tmpl&quot;),
)
</pre>
<p>The <strong>first</strong> tuple in <tt class="docutils literal">PAGES</tt> seems to have the following significance:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The command <tt class="docutils literal">nikola build</tt> parses the tuple <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(&quot;stories/*.rst&quot;,</span> &quot;stories&quot;, &quot;story.tmpl&quot;)</tt> like so: 'Look for files matching <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;stories/*.rst&quot;</span></tt>, process them using the <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;story.tmpl&quot;</tt> template, and dump the output in the <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;stories&quot;</tt> subdirectory of <tt class="docutils literal">output</tt>.</li>
<li>The command <tt class="docutils literal">nikola new_page</tt> will create a new <tt class="docutils literal">.rst</tt> file in the directory specified in the first tuple member: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;stories/*.rst&quot;</span></tt>, that is, in <tt class="docutils literal">/stories/</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives us two options, each with drawbacks.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(&quot;stories/home/*.rst&quot;,</span> &quot;&quot;, &quot;story.tmpl&quot;)</tt>, to the <strong>end</strong> of the list of other tuples.  This <strong>should</strong> tell Nikola to process files in <tt class="docutils literal">stories/home/</tt> and put the result in the &quot;&quot; subdirectory of <tt class="docutils literal">/output/</tt>.  BUT, instead it puts it in the subdirectory <tt class="docutils literal">/output/stories/home</tt>.</li>
<li>Add <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(&quot;stories/home/*.rst&quot;,</span> &quot;&quot;, &quot;story.tmpl&quot;)</tt>, to the <strong>start</strong> of the list of other tuples.  This works well.  The drawback is that the command <tt class="docutils literal">nikola new_page</tt> puts new files in <tt class="docutils literal">/stories/home</tt> instead of just <tt class="docutils literal">/stories</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter option is better, so we will go with that.  <tt class="docutils literal">PAGES</tt> now looks like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
PAGES = (
    (&quot;stories/home/*.rst&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;story.tmpl&quot;),
    (&quot;stories/*.rst&quot;, &quot;stories&quot;, &quot;story.tmpl&quot;),
    (&quot;stories/*.txt&quot;, &quot;stories&quot;, &quot;story.tmpl&quot;),
    (&quot;stories/*.html&quot;, &quot;stories&quot;, &quot;story.tmpl&quot;),
)
</pre>
