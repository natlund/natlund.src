<p>Write your page here.</p>
<p>Why the hell is this index page not the one shown on localhost:/8000?
Why is there another index page in the output folder?
Why is that other index page served instead?
How can I replace the automatically-generated index page with my one?</p>
<p>Okay, after changing to INDEX_PATH=&quot;blog&quot; in conf.py, Nikola now puts the offending index.html page away in the blog folder.
However, the index page that I want to be the home page is still not in the root of the output folder, so is not served.</p>
