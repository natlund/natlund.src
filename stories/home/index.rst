This website records various technical things I work on.  What is useful to one explorer may be useful to another, so I have made some effort to make this web repository easily accessible.

This is not really a blog.  Successful blogs follow the model of a broadcasting medium, releasing topical content on a regular schedule.  Such blogs have been likened to sharks - they need to keep moving to stay alive.  In contrast, this website is a collection of essays on diverse subjects, that are not necessarily connected to a particular point in time.

Monetary Theory
===============

What issue facing humanity influences our welfare more than any other?  What problem, if solved, could benefit the most lives to the greatest degree?  Conversely, what thing, if left unimproved, will cause the greatest suffering to the greatest number of people?

Globalization?  War?  Climate change?  Muslim terrorism?  These might be typical popular responses, but they are wrong.  My money is on money.  Monetary reform could increase the living standards of *billions* of people, at essentially no real cost.  Monetary theory and possible reforms are explored below.
