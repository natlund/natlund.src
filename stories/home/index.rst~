This website records various technical things I work on.  What is useful to one explorer may be useful to another, so I have made some effort to make this web repository easily accessible.
Therefore, this website features a collection of essays organized in various logical categories, rather than a linear sequence of articles in chronological order.  Too many good technical blogs are too difficult to browse, due to the opacity of the conventional linear blog format.

.. Therefore, it is not organized in the linear chronological fashion of a conventional blog.  Typically, a conventional linear blog succeeds if it follows the model of a broadcasting medium, releasing topical content on a regular schedule.  Such blogs have been likened to sharks - they need to keep moving to stay alive.  But a common problem with such blogs is the difficulty in browsing old but useful content.  In contrast, this website features a collection of essays organized into logical categories.  (For technical essays, the time of writing is often not particularly relevant.)


Monetary Theory
===============

What issue facing humanity influences our welfare more than any other?  What problem, if solved, could benefit the most lives to the greatest degree?  Conversely, what thing, if left unimproved, will cause the greatest suffering to the greatest number of people?

Globalization?  War?  Climate change?  Muslim terrorism?  These might be typical popular responses, but they are wrong.  My money is on money.  Monetary reform could increase the living standards of *billions* of people, at essentially no real cost.  Monetary theory and possible reforms are explored below.
